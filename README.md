# PrincetonSocialNetwork

Hi Professor Chan! Here are some instructions if you want to run the program on your computer!

First, download the files onto your computer and put them into a folder. Move them into your Documents folder.
Rename this folder (with the downloaded files) to something simple i.e. "SocialNetwork" (no spaces)

Open your terminal on the computer and run these commands to move into the right directory:
```
cd Documents
cd SocialNetwork
```

Now that you are in the correct folder, you can now run the program
In the terminal, run (you have to run this each time you want to interact with the program)
```
python network.py
```

You should be able to interact with the program from here!
You can choose different soource/destinations from the .csv file. Anyone in a row with class year of 2026, can be used.
